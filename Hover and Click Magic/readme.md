# ðŸŽ¨ Circle Grid Interaction Project

### Objective:
Create an interactive grid layout with 9 circles that respond to click and hover events using JavaScript and CSS. Upon clicking, the circles change color, and on hover, they appear transparent. 

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Project Requirements**

### 1. **HTML Structure**
   - **Grid Container**: A `div` with the class `.grid`
   - **Circle Elements**: Nine `div` elements with the class `.circle` and unique IDs from 1 to 9.
     - **ID Naming**: Each circle is identified by a unique ID (1, 2, 3, â€¦, 9)

### 2. **CSS Styling**
   - **Background Image**:
      - Apply a background image to the `body` using the URL:
        ```
        https://s3-us-west-2...
        ```
      - Set the image to **cover the entire background**.
   - **Circle Elements** (`.circle`):
      - **Shape**: Use `border-radius: 50%` to make each circle round.
      - **Initial Background Color**: `blue`
      - **Transition**: Set the background-color transition to `0.5s` for smooth color change effects.

### 3. **JavaScript Functionality**
   - **Click Event**: 
     - Add a click event listener on the `document` that changes the background color of each `.circle` when any area of the page is clicked.
     - Choose any color to replace the original blue background.
   - **Hover Effect**:
     - Implement a **transparent background color** effect on hover for each `.circle`.
     - Use JavaScript's `mouseover` and `mouseout` events to apply and remove the transparency effect.

## ðŸŒŸ **Project Highlights**
This project allows you to practice:
- Using JavaScript event listeners (`click`, `mouseover`, `mouseout`)
- Applying dynamic CSS transitions with JavaScript
- Working with hover effects through JavaScript instead of CSS
- Building a visually engaging interface with CSS Grid and rounded elements

Let your creativity shine with CSS and JavaScript in this interactive project!
