# Three Largest Ages

This project allows users to input a list of ages and dynamically displays the three largest ages in descending order. It uses JavaScript to parse, process, and render the output.

## Features

- Accepts ages as a comma-separated string from an input field.
- Processes the input to identify and sort the three largest ages.
- Displays the output dynamically in the `output` div:
