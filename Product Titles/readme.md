# Product Titles

## Description
Today we will use an API to display a list of product titles.

### API
- [Product Titles API][(https://content.newt...)](https://content.newtonschool.co/v1/pr/63b6c911af4f30335b4b3b89/products)

## Given Code
You don't have to change anything in the CSS.

### HTML Structure
- You have an `h1` element.
- You have a `div` with `id="title-container"`.

## Functionality Requirements
1. When you fetch from the API, you will get data of products.
2. From that data, we only need the "titles".
3. Get all the titles from the API and show them in the form of an unordered list inside the `div` with `id="title-container"`.
4. The titles should be listed as list elements.

### Implementation Hint
- You can use functions like `createElement` and `appendChild` to achieve this. there are boilerplate clone it in your local and try to solve it by only javascript code..

### output should look like this
